# Bioengineering

A curriculum I put together for myself, using inspiration from:
- [UC Berkeley Bioengineering](https://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/program)
    - the Bioengineering major offers four different concentrations:
        - Biomedical Devical
        - Biomedical Imaging
        - Cell and Tissue Engineering
        - Synthetic and Computational Biology
    - my two main areas of interest are *Cell and Tissue Engineering* and *Synthetic and Computational Biology*, but I'm only interested in *Biomedical Imaging* for possibly building my own bio imaging equipment
