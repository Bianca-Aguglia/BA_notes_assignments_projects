# MIT Biological Engineering

The [website for MIT BE](https://be.mit.edu/) lists thirteen different concentrations, twenty-three different areas of research and eleven research centers. The areas of research that look most interesting to me are:
- Carcinogenesis
- Computational Modeling
- Neurobiological Engineering
- Systems Biology
- Tissue Engineering
