# Bioengineering

According to usnews.com, in 2021, the top bioengineering schools in the US are:
1. Johns Hopkins University (Whiting)
2. Emory University - Georgia Institute of Technology
3.1 Duke University (Pratt)
3.2 MIT
3.3 Univesity of California - San Diego (Jacobs)
6.1 Stanford University
6.2 University of California - Berkeley
8. University of Pennsylvania
9. Columbia University
10. Boston University

The list above doesn't make a distinction between Bioengineering (BE) and Biomedical Engineering (BME). I updated it to include links to each school's BE or BME department, the school's location, and a note about whether the focus is BE or BME. The updated list is: 
1. [Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/) Baltimore, MD (BME)
2. [Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.gatech.edu/) 
- [MIT Biological Engineering](https://be.mit.edu/)
- [UC Berkeley Bioengineering](https://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/program)

Using inspiration from these schools, the curriculum I put together for myself is:
