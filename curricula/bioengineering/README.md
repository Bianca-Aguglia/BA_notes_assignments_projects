# Bioengineering

According to the [2022 U.S.News and World Report rankings](https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/biomedical-rankings), the top bioengineering schools in the US are:
1. (1) Johns Hopkins University (Whiting)
2. (2) Emory University - Georgia Institute of Technology
3. (3) Duke University (Pratt)  
4. (3) MIT  
5. (3) Univesity of California - San Diego (Jacobs)  
6. (6) Stanford University  
7. (6) University of California - Berkeley  
8. (8) University of Pennsylvania
9. (9) Columbia University
10. (10) Boston University

The list above doesn't make a distinction between Bioengineering (BE) and Biomedical Engineering (BME). I updated it to include links to each school's BE or BME department, the school's location, and a note about whether the focus is BE or BME. The updated list is: 
1. [Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/) in Baltimore, MD (BME)
2. [Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.gatech.edu/) in Atlanta, GA (BME)
3. [Duke Biomedical Engineering](https://bme.duke.edu/) in Durham, NC (BME)
4. [MIT Biological Engineering](https://be.mit.edu/) in Cambridge, MA (BE)
5. [UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering - Bioengineering](https://be.ucsd.edu/) in San Diego, CA (BE)
6. [Stanford Bioengineering - Schools of Engineering and Medicine](https://bioengineering.stanford.edu/) in 
- [UC Berkeley Bioengineering](https://bioeng.berkeley.edu/undergrad/program)

Using inspiration from these schools, the curriculum I put together for myself is:
