    "While studying physics, two main themes become clear:\n",
    "- **the underlying simplicity of natural world**: a small number of concepts, models, and laws can explain the staggering complexity of all phenomena in the universe\n",
    "- **the unifying aspect of the laws of physics**: the forces that cause stars, dust, and other forms of matter in far away galaxies such as the Whirlpool Galaxy to rotate, revolve, and move as they do are thought to be the same ones as the forces on Earth that cause water to flow over hydroelectric dams."
