# UC Berkeley Bioengineering

The [UC Berkeley Bioengineering website](https://bioeng.berkeley.edu/) lists four different concentrations for the Bioengineering major:
- Biomedical Devices
- Biomedical Imaging
- Cell and Tissue Engineering
- Synthetic and Computational Biology

My two main areas of interest are *Cell and Tissue Engineering* and *Synthetic and Computational Biology*, but I'm also interested in *Biomedical Imaging* for possibly building my own bio imaging equipment.
